## Shelly Script Examples

This document contains a few Shelly Plus script examples. Scripts are a new feature in Shelly Plus devices that are available from the 0.9.0-beta2 firmware. Since this is a beta firmware you need to install it manually (will not get updated automatically). You can do it like any firmware update from the app or web interface under Device/Firmware.
